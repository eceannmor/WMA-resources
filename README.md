# WMA Resources
This repository contains projects and other materials for students taking the WMA course at PJATK. \
The projects are meant to be completed using Python and [OpenCV](https://docs.opencv.org/). 
You are free to choose any programming language, but please keep in mind that the resources and class discussion is Python-centric. 

Each project has its own directory, where you can find the task and media for that task.

* [Project 1 - Colour identification and tracking](./project1/)
* [Project 2 - Coin tray](./project2/)
* [Project 3 - Feature matching](./project3/)
* [Project 4 - Convolutional neural networks](./project4/)

[Zero-term exam resources](./zero-exam/).

The repository is mirrored across GitHub and GitLab for redundancy.
I suggest you clone from GitLab as it is less likely to cause issues.
