# WMA Resources
This repository contains projects and other materials for students taking the WMA course at PJATK.

Each project has its own directory, where you can find the task and media for that task.

* [Project 1 - Colour identification and tracking](./project1/)
* [Project 2 - Coin tray](./project2/)

The repository is mirrored across GitHub and GitLab for redundancy. 
I suggest you clone from GitLab as it is less likely to cause issues.
